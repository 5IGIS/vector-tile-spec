The specification is versioned based on `major.minor` notation. The `major` version will be incremented with any technical change to the specification format or way it should be interpreted. Changes to the `minor` version will be reserved for any clarification or correction of clerical errors associated with the specification language.

The `major` version in the specification name is synonymous with the `version` field in a Mapbox Vector Tile layer. See the `3.1. Layers` section for more details.

Current version: **2.1**
